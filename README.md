  This is text documentation describing the application and its functionality.

this is a java powered, situational quiz game centered around my favotire sport, Baseball,

and about my favorite team, The Los Angeles Dodgers. I created this application to simulate 

more or less, the difficulty of generating offense in baseball, therefore, the quiz will prove 

to be a challenege and has been balanced for allowing enough chances for success but having a 

finite number of chances as well. This game implements a 3 strike system that simulates

real baseball rules.

  
  This quiz which I have named "Dodger Mania!" is a text based, multiple choice sports/simulation/trivia 
  
game that employs very basic user interaction and ease of use. users need only choose numbers
  
from the menu all the way to the end of the multiple choice quiz, choosing from 1-4. This application 
  
is serving as a precursor for a more sophisticated build, so this project may be considered in an 
  
"alpha stage". a fully functional GUI is planned for this application in the near future, further increasing 

user friendliness.

  
  This application employs a number of features that can be experienced as the user powered by features utilized in 
  
the java utility libraries. This program contains an initial menu option that allows for the viewing of game data,

I.E, the Dodgers lineup. Also within the application is the option to launch the game, play it and be returned

to the initial menu, where you are also able to exit out of the application with the press of a button.

This application employs text based information describing the events of an actual baseball game while staying (mostly) 

true to its rules (and java rules!). there are some bugs that persist within this build such as the sophistication of the 

strike system, but there are methods in place where strike counts reset for every new batter. This program randomizes 

questions and answers with the user having to score 5 correct answers or "consecutive home runs" to win the game.
